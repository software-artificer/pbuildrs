# Contributor's guideline
These are informal guidelines intended to make contributing easier for
everyone - both maintainers and contributors. They help save time, reduce
friction, and outline the basic expectations and social contract for working on
this project.

## Licensing
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion into this project, shall be
licensed as MIT, without any additional terms or conditions.

## Conduct
The `pbuildrs` project adheres to the [Rust Code of Conduct](
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). This
describes the _baseline_ behavior expected from all contributors.

## Use of LLMs
Please do not use an LLM to generate bug reports, issues, discussions or PRs on
your behalf. Feel free to get LLM assistance for parts where you need them, but
do not simply tell an LLM to generate things and submit them. Make sure you
actually verify everything, twice. This will help save everyone a lot of time,
believe me.

## How to contribute
There are a few ways one can contribute to this project:
1. Submitting a bug report;
1. Confirming a reported bug;
1. Fixing a reported bug;
1. Submitting a feature request;
1. Implementing a feature request;
1. Helping triage and resolve open issues;
1. Improving documentation;

### Submitting a bug report
Found a bug? Great, maintainers will be glad to know about it!

First, check if this bug is already reported. Prefer :+1: reaction on the issue
over the "affects me too message". Do provide any additional context however if
you can, it helps immensely!

If no issue open issue exists for this bug, please open a new issue and provide
a detailed description of the problem you are facing. Include reproduction
steps, code examples, information about your environment, the expected outcome
and what actually happens when a bug occurs. This helps maintainers, because
they don't have to chase you for additional information and context, but also
helps you as you don't have to go and collect extra information later.

### Confirming a bug report
If you see an open issue with a bug report and you are facing the same problem,
or if you just want to help and verify that a bug is valid, please go through
the information in the report, ensure it is complete and no context is missing,
try reproducing the problem or add additional reproduction steps if you can. By
doing so you either would ensure that the bug is actually legitimate and needs
attention or you might even be able to discover some context that helps fixing
it.

### Fixing a reported bug
If you discovered a bug and opened an issue, or if you discovered an already
reported bug that you know how to fix, feel free to open a pull request with a
proposed fix and let's work together on fixing it. Make sure that the bug is
actually confirmed though, so you don't waste your time writing code and
maintainers' time reviewing and triaging it.

### Submitting a feature request
Got a cool idea for a feature? Awesome! Let's work together and see if we can
make it happen.

First, please check any existing discussions and see if this idea or any
similar ones were already or are actively discussed and what the outcome is. Do
provide any feedback or extra context as needed.

If your idea is unique, and nobody has thought about it before -
congratulations! Please open an issue and describe the feature request in
detail. Doing so allows to make sure that the idea aligns with this project
goals and its direction. If all goes well, the maintainers will turn this into
an issue or ask you to do so. At this stage the feature is ready to be
implemented.

Please note, not all feature requests will be accepted. This is the main reason
to start the conversation first and avoid wasting effort writing any code.

### Implementing a feature request
Have you submitted an idea that was accepted by the maintainers and you want to
implement? Or did you see an open issue for a feature request that is ready to
be implemented but nobody works on and you want to do so? Excellent, we love to
see external contributions!

Please, comment on the issue and mention that you are going to be working on it
and feel free to open a PR with proposed implementation. Work with maintainers
and other contributors to land the change into the default branch.


### Triaging and resolving issues
While creating and fixing bug reports, and submitting and implementing feature
requests are primary forms of contribution, help with triaging and resolving
issues and providing feedback on pull requests is always greatly appreciated.

If you see an issue or a pull request and you can contribute additional context
to or can help drive to the resolution, please do os if time permits.

### Improving documentation
Adding new documentation, helping improve existing one, providing examples,
clarifying any confusing parts is always welcome. Feel free to open a PR with
proposed suggestions and work with other contributors and project maintainers
to land your changes.

## Asking for help
If you need help with this project, please start a new [discussion](
https://github.com/software-artificer/pbuildrs/discussions/categories/help-and-support),
do not submit an issue.
